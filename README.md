# Crisis Cleanup

App is started from [Now in Android](https://github.com/android/nowinandroid).
- build-logic keeps nowinandroid/NIA naming from the original files.
- Normally demo builds are limited/free versions. In this case treat demo as non-production builds for local development using non-production services.
- Benchmark related files and settings were removed to simplify v1.
